IMPROVED BM25 APPROACH: 
relevance(q,d) = BM25(q',d) + BM25(q",d)

PART 1:
1. Import folder consisting of only Corpus
2. Preprocess it (Lowercase, Remove Punctuation, Number Filtering, Remove Stop Words, Stemming)
3. Give tokenized corpus as input to BM25Okapi()

PART 2:
4. Import folder consisting of Corpus and Query
5. Preprocess it the same way
6. Use TF-IDF Vectorizer to find idf values on the output of Step 5
7. Extract top 50% of words from the query based on idf values, that will be the new query
8. Use bm25.getScores() to find document scores
9. These are doc_scores_A

PART 3:
10. Use output of Step 5 as the Query and Apply bm25.getScores()
11. These are doc_scores_B

PART 4:
12. ADD doc_scores_A and doc_scores_B
13. The result of Step 12 is the final relevance ranking of documents
14. Save them to a file for TREC-EVAL
